## Documentation

Read the **[official documentation](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-timed-image/)**.

[![Demo](./src/__docz__/images/demo.gif "Demo")](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-timed-image/TimedImage#usage)

üëÅÔ∏è **[Live Demo](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-timed-image/TimedImage#usage)**

## Overview

A TimedImage repeatedly renders an image at a timed interval.

Features optional client-side cache busting so the image reloads on every render.

### Features include:

- **‚è±Ô∏è Render at timed intervals**
  - Re-render your image at the interval you specify.
- **üê£ New image every time using cache-busting**
  - Uses client-side cache-busting to prevent old, cached images from being shown.
- **üñºÔ∏è Use just like an `img`**
  - Use all the props an `img` supports, like `src` and `alt`.

## Installation

```
npm i react-timed-image
```

## Quick Start

```jsx
import { TimedImage } from "react-timed-image";
```

```jsx
<TimedImage src="https://loremflickr.com/220/140" interval={3000} />
```

This will render the image at the `src` provided every three seconds.

See [TimedImage](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-timed-image/TimedImage) for additional options and a live example.
