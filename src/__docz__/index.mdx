👁️ **[Live Demo](/TimedImage#usage)**

## Overview

A TimedImage repeatedly renders an image at a timed interval. 

Features optional client-side cache busting so the image reloads on every render.

### Features include:

- **⏱️ Render at timed intervals**
  - Re-render your image at the interval you specify.
- **🐣 New image every time using cache-busting**
  - Uses client-side cache-busting to prevent old, cached images from being shown.
- **🖼️ Use just like an `img`**
  - Use all the props an `img` supports, like `src` and `alt`.

## Installation

```
npm i react-timed-image
```

## Quick Start

```jsx
import { TimedImage } from 'react-timed-image';
```

```jsx
<TimedImage src="https://loremflickr.com/220/140" interval={3000} />
```

This will render the image at the `src` provided every three seconds.

See [TimedImage](/TimedImage) for additional options and a live example.
